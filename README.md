# EEUnlocker
#### A user-friendly tool to enable the long-awaited EEU patches for Windows 11 in other regions to make Windows... usable!

This tool works by giving you a user-friendly list of the available policy settings, and automates the process of adding your device region into the allowed regions list, as well as enabling/disabling the policies that you selected.

## Requirements:
- `ViveTool`: Used to enable the rollout features
- `NSudo`: Used to elevate this appliation so that we can modify the JSON file that controls the EEU settings
